## whono  
Whono is a 2+ player card game where you draw and place cards continually, with the goal of being the first player to put all their cards down and thus have an empty hand.

### how to play
In Whono, there are several types of cards. These are:

##### Colour cards
- number cards
- draw 2 cards
- colour draw 4 cards
- reverse cards
- skip cards

##### Special cards
- wild cards
- wild draw 4 cards

#### Colour card rules
Colour cards can only be placed when the previous card place matches either their colour, or their number (in the case of placing a number card).

Card functions: 
- Number cards have no function. Placing a number card does nothing.
- Placing a draw 2 card means the player after you has to draw two cards and add them to their hand.
- Placing a draw 4 card means the player after you has to draw four cards and add them to their hand.
- Placing a reverse card reverses the order in which players play - so the next person to play would be the person who played just before you.
- Placing a skip card causes the player after you to have to skip a turn.

#### Wild card rules
Wild cards can be placed whenever, no matter the colour of the card played previously.

Card functions:
- Normal cards have no function. Placing a normal wild card does nothing.
- Placing a draw 4 card means the player after you has to draw four cards and add them to their hand.
