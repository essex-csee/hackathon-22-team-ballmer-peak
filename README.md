## whono
Whono is a 2+ player card game where you draw and place cards continually, with the goal of being the first player to put all their cards down and thus have an empty hand.
--- ---
### about
In Whono, there are several types of cards. These are number cards, with a number from 1 to 9.

Number cards can only be placed when the previous card place matches either their colour or their number.

The goal of Whono is to place all the cards in your hand as fast as possible.

### how to play
When it is your turn, you can click a card (at the bottom of the screen) to place it. If the card is eligible to be placed, it will be added to the pile. The pile is the stack with the cards facing upwards.

If you run out of cards that can be placed, click the deck to add another card to your hand. The deck is the stack with the cards facing downwards.

You win when you place all the cards in your hand on to the pile. You lose if someone does this before you.
